# Producing-Sine-Wave-TivaC
Lab13 in edX shape the world course to produce sine waves of different frequencies using 3 digital pins with DAC external circuit using resistors only
This code is tested via TeXas simulation provided by dr.Jonathan Valvano and got the Full grade in the grading simulation tool 
The TivaC generates different tones of sine waves of different frequenices using 4 GPIO pins connected to DAC external circuitary and 4 switches each indicates a wave 
 certuan frequency when pressed.
 Hope you like my Lab assignment <3 <3
